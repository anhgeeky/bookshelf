			"review": "I am a sucker for a self help book. Very similar to a lot of other self help books I've read, take responsibility. Set goals. Happiness comes from solving problems. Choose your struggle. You are not special. Things fall apart. The tyranny of exceptionalism. B-b-b-but, if I'm not going to be special or extraordinary, what's the point. The value of suffering. You are always choosing. The responsibility/fault fallacy. Genetics and the hand we're dealt.   How to be a little less certain of yourself.  Pain is part of the process.  The importance of saying no. Rejection makes your life better. Boundaries. How to build trust. Freedom through commitment."

Traditional Labour voters, older working class being left behind, being taken for granted no longer being listened to. It was there in the focus groups but the political parties (and everyone else) missed it."

			"review": "Rory Stewart didn't seem like he wasn't your average Conservative politician during the leadership election and this book confirmed this for me. An incredibly interesting read about him walking solo from Herat to Kabul after the 2001 invasion following 9/11. A real insight into the lives people of Northern Afghanistan, which is a complete contrast with everything I know having spent all my life in the west. The stories of how he slept on villagers' floors, shared their meals, and listened to their stories of the recent and ancient past was riveting, coinciding with the stories of the heroes, rogues, tribal elders and teenage soldiers that he met. The encounter with Taliban commanders was also a tense couple of pages."

Mad that he never intended for this to be read, these are personal notes. They are very clearly mental notes for himself, I have sympathy for the writing style though as I am similar, writing short notes/thoughts for myself to come back to later. 1) You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 2) Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking. "

The AS issue in this book though was an eye opener, there did seem to be more of a tolerance of it in the party (which is obviously awful) and there were many opportunities to fix the issue but he didn't. Everyone knew that 2019 would be a disaster too and no one did anything about it. Shocking really."

Akala does a great job of going over the history of racism in the UK, the Windrush Generation and how racism isn't always the stereotypical stuff you imagine but the subtle behaviours that people change when around people of a different race. The things he had to endure throughout school was awful to read, essential reading for anyone living in Britain."

Address leasing companies help them get away with it. Diplomatic status can be assigned to anyone by cash-strapped governments so that they can enjoy diplomatic immunity.

The stories of Churchill climbing to the roof of number 10 so he could watch the bombers fly over London is nuts. Listening on Audible was good, although because of the detail that's packed into the book, I feel I may have missed details because I was listening to it instead of reading. Never realised how much Churchill was relying on the US to enter the war either, that was eye opening. The use of journals, diaries and other mixed accounts from surrounding characters was ingenious too as it helped paint a grander picture of all the moving parts of the Blitz. A close up view of a difficult time in the worlds history."

Made me think about the complexities of the universe and how we're definitely not alone in the universe. If we are (as there always has to be a first), christ that's scary."

			"review": "An interesting read and lives up to the hype around it, (I mean it must have because his last name became synonymous with being sneaky) but yeah in summary, is it okay to do anything it takes to win? Key point r.e politics I took from it was to protect a country it needs its own army, not mercenaries. Makes sense really. Down to people wanting to fight for something instead of being paid to fight for a thing they don't believe in. "

			"review": "Christ, Britain did some messed up shit in Kenya. The prison memoirs paint a vivid picture of life inside the prison and the effects of being starved of human contact whilst in isolation. The human mind is fragile and the author does a good job describing the internal struggle he's dealing with. The fact that he was arrested for simply bringing communities together over a play is nuts. The book does an excellent job of unapologetically taking you through some very important historical times in Kenya."

			"review": "The book dragged, A LOT. Filled with quick little facts and tid bits of history, referencing the origin or words. Talked about language in ad reads which is also interesting to be me, and it did provide insight on the English language, how sentence structure is important and how those sentences influences how people think. But christ, a lot of waffle which is ironic as the author makes the case to get to the point when writing sentences."

			"review": "Incredible. Such a good read, will be purchasing a pair of Vibram five fingers and modifying running technique to improve running distance. Good motivation for running a marathon. Makes it seem achievable considering the runners in this book are running 100 mile ultras in 40 degree heat. I can run a marathon. Maybe I should try being a vegetarian. The narrative throughout the book is great, the science and facts that weave in and out of the story is done so well, it really keeps you turning the page want to find out what happens next. I enjoy running already but this has taken my love of running to new heights. "
